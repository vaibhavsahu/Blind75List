public class LargestConnectedComponentInBinarySquareGrid {
    /*
    Each of the cells in a given square grid is assigned a value of either "0" or "1".
    A grid cell is connected to another cell only if they share a common side.
    A connected component is a set of directly or indirectly connected cells, each with the value "1".
    Find the largest possible size of a connected component achievable by changing the value of at most
     one cell from "0" to "1" in the grid.

            Example One
            {
            "grid": [
                [1, 0],
                [0, 0]
                ]
            }
    Output: 2
    Changing any of the two "0"s adjacent to the "1" forms a component of size 2.

    Example Two
            {
        "grid": [
            [1, 1],
            [1, 1]],
            }
    Output: 4
    There are no cells with the value "0",
     so no operations can be performed. But the whole grid is already connected with size 4.
